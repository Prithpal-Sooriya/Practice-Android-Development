(this is my first time using a site like Udacity, so the notes will be a work in progress)

Introduction:
  This course will cover:
    Fundamentals of how Android works
    Android patterns and best practices
    etc...

  Also will have to do my own research on information, such as:
    Sample code
    Visiting the Android Developer Site
    Android Developers on Google+
    Android Developers on Twitter
    Android Questions on Stack Overflow
    Github Guides: https://guides.github.com/
    etc...
