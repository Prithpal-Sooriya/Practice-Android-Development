    Good thing so that support to older version can cause problems due to features/hardware and older API'

Target SDK:
  Declares which android version you have tested on
  App Targeted will be FORWARD compatible to newer SDK's
    Ensures that app will still function with new devices

How to Select a Min SDK
  Select a version which most of your users will use
  Ensure that the min SDK will have the hardware you want to implement

How to Select a Target SDK
  Select the most latest SDK released so to ensure that the app works well
  If a new SDK is released, change the target SDK to the new SDK and test the new SDK
