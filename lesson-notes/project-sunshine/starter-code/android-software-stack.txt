Android Software Stack

Android is full software stack
  Adspace is a Linux Kernel
    low level tasks

  Then there are Core Libraries
    core C, C++, SQLite,
    Android Runtime (android virtual machine)

  Then Application framework
    own code and libraries/api's will run here

  Lastly is Application Layer
    where all application are located and ran (where the user can interact)

What happens to code
  Converted into bytecode (that can be run on android virtual machine)
  Then this is installed onto the device

  In android studio, the process above (HLL --> bytecode --> android virtual machine)
    happens with gradle (a build toolkit, that does everything!)
      Will build Android project
      convert code into bytecode, resources, manifest (whole this here is called APK)

      Jar Signer will sign the code
      ADB (android debug bridge) will install onto device
