Min SDK will be Gingerbread
  As this follows the Udacity Course
  Also now covers approximately 100% of devices

Choosing a template: Blank Activity with fragments
  New versions do not contain this anymore, so will need to select:
    Empty Activity
    Add own fragment in (infromation to create fragments found here)
      https://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/creating.html
      https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html
    The code for the new fragment needs to be placed into Java and XML
      The java code can be placed into a separate class or an inner class
      <java>
        public class MainFragment extends Fragment {
          @override
          public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container
            Bundle savedInstanceState) {
              //inflate the layout for this fragment
              View rootView = infater.inflate(R.layout.[xml fragment], container, false);
              return rootView;
            }
        }
      </java>

      XML code to insert (XML will be in a separate file)
      <XML>
        <fragment
          android:name="com.example.android.fragments.[java class location of fragment]"
          android:id="@+id/[name of fragment]"
          -- extras
          android:layout_weight="1"
          android:layout_width="0dp"
          android:layout_height="match_parent"
        />
      </XML>

      The [java class location] above can be
        normal class:
          <class name>
        inner class:
          <inner class name>$<inner class name>

The java version of the fragment can be combined with java activity
  Called FragmentActivity (so <class> extends FragmentActivity)

Once app is created, go into app folder--> build.gradle file
  ensure that the target SDK is the latest release

Next select a new image for the app
  right click onto app folder and select:
    "new image asset"
