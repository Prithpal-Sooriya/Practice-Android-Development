Main thread vs Background thread
  Main thread:
    Android apps run default on the main thread
    Main thread also called UI thread
      Handles all user input and output (e.g. screen drawing)
    Ensure to avoid any time-consuming operations
      otherwise screen will stutter
      place time-consuming operations onto a background worker thread
        great for any long running work (which could also be blocking code)

  Background thread
    Also called (is a embodies) background worker thread
    Great for long running operations/blocking code
    Examples of long running work:
      network calls
      decoding bitmaps
      reading/writing from a database
