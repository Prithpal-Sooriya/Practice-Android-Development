THERE IS AN ERROR IN THE CODE (the code crashes)
  Reason because (after using logs to find error):
    NetworkOnMainThreadException
    Error caused due to: urlConnection.connect();
      Due to not being allowed to have networking code on the main thread as it may take too long
      So instead create a thread for the networking code (connecting to the api)
        This follows onto 2.02-refactor-forecast-fragment
