Logcat
  This is a debugging tool (similar to output onto command line)
    Displays text you place from:
      Log.e("PlaceholderFragment", "Error closing stream", e);
    They log error messages

  With ADB command line tool (and device plugged in)
    type in the app directory: adb logcat
      Will show all debug and error messages printed into logcat
  Also can see logs using Android Studio
    Click on green Android button ("Android Device Monitor")
    Then click on logcat tab to see log messages

Determining log level
  When using log to print errors, need to determine what log level it should be displayed at:
  Log levels and their java code:
    Error - kept during runtime, Log.e(String tag, String message)
    Warn - kept during runtime, log.w(String tag, String message)
    Info - kept during runtime, Log.i(String tag, String message)
    Debug - Compiled in, but stripped during runtime, Log.d(String tag, String message)
    Verbose - should never be compiled into app, except for development Log.v(String tag, String message)

  Parameters for log (String tag, String message)
    String tag = log tag, any String you want to identify log message
      Good practice to define log tag as a CONSTANT in your class (name of class or App)
    String message = actual log message you want to display

    PRO TIP: avoid log spam!!!
