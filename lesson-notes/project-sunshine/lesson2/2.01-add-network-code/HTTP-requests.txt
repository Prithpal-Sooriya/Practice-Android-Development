HTTP request for weather
  1) make HTTP request
    pass the URL that we have created in the research:
      api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?q=Bristol,GB&mode=json&units=metric&cnt=7&APPID=...

  2) read the response from an input stream
    The response is in JSON format (so will get a JSON string)
      so we read this and get the data we need

  3) clean up and log errors
    disconnecting connection
    closing any input streams
    log errors if they occur/are caught

Http Requests
  To send/receive data over a connection, there are 2 clients on android:
    HttpURLConnection (newer-ish)
      USE THIS: it is general purpose, lightweight, optimised for most android apps
    HttpClient (Apache class, older and will support Android Froyo and below)

  Both support:
    HTTPS, streaming uploads and downloads, configurable time outs
    IPV-6, and connection pooling
