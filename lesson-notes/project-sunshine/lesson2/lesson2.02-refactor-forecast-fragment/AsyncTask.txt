AsyncTask
  This allows you to only focus on:
    the app logic
    processes on the background thread
    process of bringing the data from background thread to the main thread
  Do not need to worry about the details about threads and handlers

  doInBackground() HAS to be implemented
    so it can process the parameter/s passed through
    Can also call publishProgress() as many times as you want
      So you can pass information to the UI thread (so the UI can update to know how much % of work is done!)
      It triggers onProgressUpdate() (that is called in the UI thread) with some information
  onPostExecute() = return the producing data/returning data back to main thread
  onPreExecute() = return item before execution to the main thread
    Executed before doInBackground() method, so can do any setup work
  onProgressUpdate() = return progress data of how far the data is to being complete/what stage data is at being done
    These are optional

  Methods to be called in background thread
    doInBackground()

  Methods to be called in UI/main thread
    onPreExecute()
    onProgressUpdate()
    onPostExecute()
