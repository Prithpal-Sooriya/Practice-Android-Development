Menu Buttons

  Lets add a refresh button to the app
    For temporary purposes only though (as keeping it is bad design for this app)

  Menu options
    What is a menu?
      For example: the 3 dots on the top right hand corner of the device
      The section where you can open up settings and other commands

    These are defined in XML
    Can be declared for fragments or activities

    When fragment/activity is created
      Inflates menu XML into actual menu items
        They can contains action buttons
          Action buttons = menu items that appear in the action bar
            E.g. Search menu item
        Other action buttons that are less important
          They will go into overflow menu (where the 3 dots are located)
            These items are ordered from:
              Most Frequently used (at the top of the list)
              Least Frequently used (at bottom of the list)
            Larger screens will allow some items in the overflow menu to be placed onto the action bar
