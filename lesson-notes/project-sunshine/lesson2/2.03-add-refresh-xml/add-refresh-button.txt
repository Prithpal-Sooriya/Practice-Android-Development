Add refresh button into app

  Right now...
    We have been using fake data to simulate the weather data

  What we need to get done
    Need to add code that creates a background thread (from the main thread)
    For debugging purposes, it would be great if we could execute task any time we wanted
      So add refresh menu option for debugging
      NOTE: this should not be shipped with final app
        due to the amount of calls allows is once every 10 min
