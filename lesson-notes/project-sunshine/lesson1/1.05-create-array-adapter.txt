Create an array adapter

Array adapter = will be used to populate the ListView of fake data

How the adapter works
  1) Create/ have raw data (array/list of objects)

  2) Initialise the adapter
    Pass the data to it as a reference
    The Adapter knows how to populate list item data for different data items
      Knows by the XML layout you pass to it (to know how to order list)

  3) Don't need to create view to the items of data
    Only need to do this when the ListView requests that it needs them

  3) When ListView requests, it asks how many data in dataset
    The adapter returns the number of items
    ListView will start at position 0

Code for the array adapter
  initialise adapter:
    create ArrayAdapter<String> in PlaceholderFragment.java onCreateView

  parameters:
    Context
      --> global info about app environment
      --> access system services and resources (+ app resources)
      --> getActivty(), used due to fragment activity

    ID of list item layout
      --> needs reference to XML layout we have defined
      --> R.Layout.list_item_forecast (R.layout = layout)

    ID of TextView
      --> need reference to TextView in the XML layout
      --> R.id.list_item_forecast_textview (R.id = id on an item)

    list of data
      --> this is the arraylist of data:
      --> Arraylist called: weekForecast
