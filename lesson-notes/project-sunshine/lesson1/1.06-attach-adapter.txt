Attach Adapter

Once Adapter is initialised, need to attach it to the listview
  need to get the listview

Finding Views
  When XML views are compiled, they create a view hierarchy
    Root layout at the top of the tree

  Can assign ID's to each view in the tree (imageView, textView, layouts, buttons, ...)
    however ID not required if you don't need reference to view

  When calling java code: findViewById(R.id.button)
    will go through each element in tree (breadth search)
      will find element
      will throw error

    You can also call findViewById(...), of a child of a parent already created
      e.g.
      //parent found
      LinearLayout container = (LinearLayout) this.findViewById(R.id.container);

      //find textview in subtree of parent
      //will speed up searching for item
      TextView t = (TextView) container.findViewById(R.id.txt);
