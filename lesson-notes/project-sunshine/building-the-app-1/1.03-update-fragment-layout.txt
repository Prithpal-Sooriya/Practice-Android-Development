Update Fragement layout

Layouts are used to hold GUI elements in

However issues can occur to GUI when:
  flipping the screen
  different size devices

Responsive design
  Absolute Layout used to be a thing
    pixel by pixel GUI
  However deprecated since it doesn't work with other screen sized and resolutions

  Important to build layouts to be reasonably flexible with different size devices
    One route is to design GUI for some common device sizes
      Think about sizes for:
        small phone
        large phone
        medium tablet
        large tablet

Different layouts/ Layout Managers
  3 common layouts to build UI:
    Frame Layout
      Great for simple layouts when only have one child to view
        e.g. listView

    Linear Layout
      Perfect for stacking views horizontally or vertically, one after another
        Allows the items inside to break display proportionately

    Relative Layout
      Complicated, but powerful
        Configure each view to layout or sibling views

Scroll view vs List View
  Both do the same thing
  ScrollView can be slower
    as needs to load each item when comes onto screen
  ListView faster
    as has a buffer above and below list, so can preload items before shown on screen
    also removes/recycles old views when too far off screen
      recycles top buffer and bottom buffer if scrolling down or up

Recycling items in view are for each child of AdapterView
  ListView
  GridView
